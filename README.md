# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Project Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a project that aims to recognize emotions from speech using machine learning techniques. The system processes audio inputs and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, etc. The project utilizes Python and key libraries such as TensorFlow, Librosa, and Scikit-learn.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately identify emotions from speech using the RAVDESS dataset. The model employs an MLP Classifier for classification and is trained on extracted features from the dataset.
