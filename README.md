# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Project Overview

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a project that aims to recognize emotions from speech using machine learning techniques. The system processes audio inputs and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, etc. The project utilizes Python and key libraries such as TensorFlow, Librosa, and Scikit-learn.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately identify emotions from speech using the RAVDESS dataset. The model employs an MLP Classifier for classification and is trained on extracted features from the dataset.

## FeaTechnologhies Used

### Programming Language:

- Python

### Libraries and Frameworks:

- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Soundfile
- Scikit-learn
- PyAudio
- Librosa

### Tools and Platforms:

- Python IDE
- Jupyter Lab
- Windows 10 (64-bit)

## Dataset

The project uses the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset, which contains speech samples labeled with different emotions. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Model Details

The project employs an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) Classifier, which is a type of neural network model suitable for classification tasks. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained to classify emotions based on extracted audio features.
